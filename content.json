I can’t replicate the results on my XPS 15 RTX 3050TI 4GB GPU, which forces me to look at other resources. Looking at the pricing and setup needed to work with cloud computing, I found better returns by building my own deep-learning workstation. Trying and replicating the results of these repos are absolutely important for learning and creativity. Crazy GPU Speed isn’t my focus at the moment, but large GPU mem is the key. 3060 seems to be the most price efficient one in the market at this point.

This blog isn’t the final version yet. A range space is a pair $P$, $H$: $P$ is set of all possible test/training points (can be infinite) $H$ is a hypothesis class (set the boundary of legal classifiers), a set of hypotheses (classifiers) e.g. all the linear classifiers Suppose all training pts &amp; test pts are drawn independently from same prob. distribution $\\mathcal D$ defined on domain $P$ $h\\in \\mathcal H$ be a hypothesis (a classifier), h predicts a pt x is in class C if $x\\in h$ Risk (generalization error) $R(h)$ of $h$ is the probability that $h$ misclassifies a random pt $x$ drawn from $\\mathcal D$ (i.e. the prob that $x\\in C$ but $\\notin h$) ← essentially test error risk is the average test error for test points drawn randomly from $\\mathcal D$ (但我们一般是一个 subset of the theoretical entire set of $\\mathcal D$, so test error sometimes is high, sometimes is low). Notation: Let $X\\subseteq P$ be a set of $n$ training pts drawn from $\\mathcal D$ Empirical risk (training error) $\\hat R(h)$ is % of $X$ misclassified by $h$ $h$ misclassfies each training pt w/ prob. $R(h)$, so total misclassified has a binomial distributio. $P(|\\hat R(h)-R(h)|&gt;\\epsilon) \\le2e^{-2\\epsilon^2n}$ when n is very large, the probability gets smaller. Idea for learning algorithm: choose $\\hat h\\in H$ that minimizes $\\hat R(\\hat h)$ ← empirical risk minimization Problem: if too many hypotheses, some $h$ with high $R(h)$ will get lucky and have very low $\\hat R(h)$ we can have so many hypotheses that some of them just get lucky and score far lower training error than their actual risk. → This is overfitting Dichotomies a dichotomy of $X$ is $X \\cap h$, where $h\\in H$ picks out the training points that $h$ predicts are in class $C$ e.g. for $n$ training points, there could be up to $2^n$ dichotomies. $\\hat R(\\hat h) = 0$ even if every $h\\in H$ has high risk we simply overfits We limit to have a constant $\\prod$ dichotomies, $P(\\text{at least one dichotomy has } |\\hat R - R|\\ge\\epsilon)\\le\\delta$ $\\delta = 2\\prod e^{-2\\epsilon^2n}$ Hence with prob. $\\ge 1-\\delta$ for every $h\\in H$ $\\downarrow$ complement of the above inequality $|\\hat R(h) - R(h)| \\le \\epsilon = \\sqrt{\\frac 1{2n}ln\\frac{2\\prod}{\\delta}}$ 💡Lesson: the smaller we make $\\prod$, the number of dichotomies, and larger the n, the number of training points, the more accurately the training error will approximate how well the classifier performs on test data. Smaller $\\prod$ means we’re less likely to overfit, we have less variance, but more bias. But it doesn’t mean that risk is small. Goal: we want a H that fits the data well and doesn’t produce many dichotomies. Let $h^* \\in H$ minimizes $R(h^*)$: “best” classifier Let $\\hat h\\in H$ minimizes $\\hat R(\\hat h)$; the classifier we learn, with prob $\\ge 1-\\delta$, our chosen $\\hat h$ has nearly optimal risk: Note: we still choose the best classifier $\\hat h$ that minimizes the empirical risk. We don’t know the actual $h^*$ since we have no means to know it. But if $\\prod$ is small and $n$ is large, the hypothesis $\\hat h$ we have chosen is probably nearly as good as $h^{*}$. We have the following inequalities: $R(\\hat h) \\le \\hat R(\\hat h) +\\epsilon$ got from previous inequalities since $\\hat R$ is lowest on classifiers trained on training data, it’s not the lowest on the theoretical optimal $\\hat h$. Then, using the previous inequality again, we have $\\hat R (h^{*})+ \\epsilon \\le R(h^*) + 2\\epsilon$ To sum up, Sample complexity: the # of training pts needed to achieve this $\\epsilon$ with prob $\\ge 1-\\epsilon$","link":"/blog/2023/05/07/learning-theory/"},{"title":"template post with syntax","text":"Source This is a page that showcases all the syntax that are supported by fluid and hexo.
