description: To align your work with wrapping text around, Use Alt-Z in Visual Studio
---

In Visual Studio Code, you can wrap lines of code or text in a few different ways to make them easier to read. Here are the common methods to wrap lines in Visual Studio Code:

1. **Word Wrap:**
   - Visual Studio Code has a "Word Wrap" feature that allows lines to wrap at the viewport's edge. To enable it, go to the menu:
     - View > Toggle Word Wrap
   - You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Alt + Z` (Windows/Linux) or `Option + Z` (macOS) to toggle word wrap.
